One thought:

From Gaia, query everything at similar parallax as the cluster (like ~0.85 mas, plus or minus 0.3 mas).

proper motions of mu_delta, mu_alpha* = 1.8, -2.5, plus or minus 3 or 4 mas/yr.

RA, dec J2000
108.503 -25.724   (center of cluster), plus or minus 0.5 degrees (circle).

----------

get the positions, proper motions, 3-band photometry, parallaxes.

Overplot the CLUSTER MEMBERS reported by CG18. (And maybe by K13).

And see how your target star differs from other stars in this neighborhood.

(And if it does... i.e. whether the error bars should be trusted, or not).

----------

ran it as NGC 2354 neighborhood query:

select g.source_id, g.phot_bp_mean_mag, g.phot_rp_mean_mag, g.phot_g_mean_mag,
g.parallax, g.ra, g.dec, g.pmra, g.pmdec
from gaiadr2.gaia_source as g
WHERE
g.parallax > 0.60
and
g.parallax < 1.10
and
g.dec < -25.2
and
g.dec > -26.2
and
g.ra > 108
and
g.ra < 109
and
g.phot_g_mean_mag < 17
