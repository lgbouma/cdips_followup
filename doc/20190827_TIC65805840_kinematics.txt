On the absolute RV of the cluster and star

The star was quoted by Kharchenko+13 as an NGC 2354 member (300 Myr old).  The
kinematics and parallaxes look pretty good (see attached).  This cluster was
quoted by Soubiran+19 to have an RV of 34.4 +/- 0.2 km/s.

((The Soubiran cluster RV, 34.4 +/- 0.2 km/s, has an uncertainty that is being
quoted for the mean. In other words, Soubiran et al scaled it down by sqrt(N),
where there were N=31 Gaia DR2 stars with RVs for the cluster. So the typical
scatter in RVs for cluster members is then ~0.2*sqrt(31) ~= 1km/s.   An
independent measurement of the cluster RV from RAVE (Conrad+2017) is 33.4 +/-
0.3 km/s.))

The star has a gamma velocity of 29.59 +- 0.67 km/s from WiFeS, 30.79 +- 0.03
km/s from HARPS, and 30.86 +- 0.01 km/s from FEROS. So it's pretty close to the
cluster value, (and may be within the actually spread of the distribution if
you looked at the reference).  The quick reduction of the FEROS data gives a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.2 +- 0.2, and vsini = 15 +- 0.7 km/s.

So overall, the ~30-31km/s from the WiFeS/HARPS/FEROS RVs seem pretty
consistent with the star being a cluster member.

(( HOWEVER true assessment of the statistical weight of this statement depends
on what the velocity distribution of neighboring stars in ra/dec/parallax space
is)).

------

The proper motion is a little bit off... compared to the Kharchenko members.

Conrad+17 also found [Fe/H] = -0.1 +/- 0.1 for NGC 2354 based on RAVE spectra,
consistent with the metallicity from Feros.

Conrad+17 also derived an independent cluster age of log(t) = 8.1, i.e. ~120
Myr instead of the ~300 Myr found by Kharchenko+13.


------

How do the proper motions compare to the Cantat-Gaudin values?  CG18 gives

Cluster
pmRA = -2.885 +/- 0.106  mas/yr (where the uncertainty is without sqrt shenanigans)
pmDEC = 1.832 +/- 0.111  mas/yr
plx = 0.753 +/- 0.035    mas

For this star, we have ---
pmRA = -2.348 +/- 0.024 mas/yr
pmDEC = 0.978 +/- 0.022 mas/yr
plx = 0.96 Â± 0.02 mas

And the RVs have
Soubiran+19 RV = 34.4 +/- 0.2 km/s.
Star RV ~30-31km/s from the WiFeS/HARPS/FEROS

Note that the radius containing 50% of members was found by CG18 to be
0.152 degrees ~= 550 arcseconds... (much bigg

Expected distance is 1278.5 pc. (And this radius corresponds to
550arcsec*1278.5pc = 703175.0 AU = 3.4 pc).
(The typical OC radius is like 10 pc).

The star has d = 1/omega_as = 1039 pc.
And a rather confidently quoted parallax as above.
However if the parallax were systematically off by 0.1 milliarcsec (and in the
direction that pushed it lower)... 

Recall that the Gaia systematic global parallax offset is of order 100
microarcsec = 0.1 mas.

Leung & Bovy 2019 showed that this offset varies with color, apparent
magnitude, and effective temperature 

They report it is like tilde -20 microarcsec for G_BP-G_RP = 0.7
tilde -40 microarcsec for G=13.

And tilde -60 microarcsec for fainter, redder stars (Which presumably make up
most of the cluster)

So it could be that the clusters are estimated to be systematically further
(smaller parallax) than the blue members.

====================

So let's be clear about the cluster membership.

If you believe the ERROR BARS... and perhaps you SHOULD... this thing is on the
cluster OUTSKIRTS.

Neither its proper motions, its parallax, nor its radial velocity agree within
the uncertainties of the cluster parameters. It's perhaps 200 pc too close,
compared to predictions.

In addition, CG18 did not report it as a member.

====================

TODO:
* how can we tell if it is a member or not? I would say the kinematics are
  SUGGESTIVE BUT INCONCLUSIVE. b/c of the error bars, above.

well...
* the stellar properties from the HR diagram imply an age constraint. if it
  consistent with the 100-300 Myr found by Conrad17 and/or K13, good.

* the rotation might be extractable?

Regardless, it seems like even after brief inspection, we should be skeptical
of the cluster membership.

The standard 4-panel
parallax   pmDec vs pmRA
G vs Bp-Rp  Dec vs RA

plots might look a fair bit worse with the CG18 members instead of the
Kharchenko ones...
