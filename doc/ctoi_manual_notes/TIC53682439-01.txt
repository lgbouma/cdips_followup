* TIC53682439.01_OIBEO_2m0_20200113_ip_240_0.5
  PMS M dwarf, T=15, Rp=20Re.
  * check if the density of the host star and Rp/R* inferred from the higher
    precision transit follow-up are consistent with a planet size object transiting
    the candidate host star. 

From LCO2m, have Rp/Rstar=0.24894.
TIC8 gives Rstar = 0.80, Mstar=0.56, Teff=3725K
Gaia DR2 gives Rstar 0.84, Mstar=0.86, Teff=3646K, Lstar=0.113Lsun

Multiplying gives Rp=1.93-2.03Rjup, depending which Rstar you take.

From Joel's report,
Transit duration:   1.61 hour (longer than TESS best-fit 1.2 hour)
Period:     0.64132155

Tdur = T0 * sqrt(1-b^2),  = 13hr * (P/1yr)^{1/3] * (rho/rhosun)^{-1/3} * sqrt(1-b^2)

so

(rho/rhosun)^{-1/3} = (Tdur/13hr) * (P/1yr)^{-1/3} * (1-b^2)^{-1/2}

(rho/rhosun) = (Tdur/13hr)^{-3} * (P/1yr) * (1-b^2)^{3/2}

for this object, would infer from the transit duration that

(rho/rhosun) = 0.924 * (1-b^2)^{3/2}.

For comparison...
rho/rhosun = (M/Msun) * (R/Rsun)^{-3}

If TIC8: rho/rhosun = 1.09
If GaiaDR2: rho/rhosun = 1.45

From the densities above, if TIC8 is correct, then we're reasonably close.

A few notes.

Zari 2018's calculated extinction correction for this one is not that bad. A_G = 0.226 mag.

The Measured
G = 16.34
Bp= 17.48
Rp= 15.27

Bp-Rp = 2.21
and E(Bp-Rp) = 0.11, so (Bp_Rp)_0 = 2.1 - 2.3 (depending on sign).

M = m - 5log10(d_pc) + 5

so
M_G = 16.34 - 5log10( 1/(2.0162e-3) ) + 5 = 7.86

and then add (subtract?) like 0.2 for A_G.

So... it could just be a triple!

Showing that this star is truly young will be a challenge. It's an M dwarf, and it's above the main sequence. But it
could just be a triple! Its crazy rotation is typical of M dwarfs for a long time, and doesn't contain much age
information, other than "<~5 Gyr".

What we really want would be an AO image that lets us determine whether (or not) there are companions.
Zorro on Gemini-S?
"In speckle mode they provide simultaneous two-color diffraction-limited optical imaging (FWHM~0.02" at 650nm) of
targets as faint as V~17 over a 6.7" field of view."

TBH seems like the only chance, unless spectral indications can say anything for young M dwarfs.

Answer: West et al (2011) showed that past ~M4 stars get much more Halpha active.
If this one is <M4 (e.g., at Teff=3700K, assuming constant PMS, would be M1-2), and showed Halpha emission, could be a
decent youth suggestor.

But the point is: you would need to have ALL of these factors work TOGETHER. So shouldn't retire it, but probably should
consider pursuing other easier targets first.
