ON LITHIUM
TIC 268:

- Gaia-ESO, Randich+18, and Li:

  - were their Pmemb determined from kinematics, or with lithium?
  "Cluster membership probabilities for the Gaia-ESO Survey targets are derived
  based on several spectroscopic tracers."

  answer: it's claimed that it'll be explained in some future paper, but it's not.

  - in addition, they targeted stars that they THOUGHT to be members based on
    previous literature, in particular previousl literature that already
    filtered for lithium. so any Li-poor member stars (if they exist), should
    not be in the target star sample. (...)

  ~ how many non-detections in NGC 2516?

  ~ for stars with 5400-5800K, how many of the Randich members showed Li?
    - A: most. perhaps not all. but given their selection funtion ("stars that
      already showed Li"), this is meaningless.

  - Reasons to be worried:
    - some NGC 2516 members in a Teff = 5400 - 5800 K range do show lithium
      abundances.

  - Reasons to cast doubt:
    - different instrument! UVES/GIRAFFE vs PFS--> different SNR and resoln.
    - The Randich+2018 selection function pre-assumed Li-rich stars (section
      3.1). It can't be used to assess the Q: "if I don't see Li, can it still
      be a cluster member?"

  - Read Boesgaard+2016 to understand the Hyades state of the art Li
    measurements.

  - Email Boesgaard asking about intermediate age Li results. 100-300Myr. E.g.,
    there's Fig 5 of the Berger+ paper showing the Hyades result. Are there
    younger? Could we have detected that kind of Li EW??? 
    (Did we have the S/N?)

----------

We don't see Li in the PFS template.

From the Randich+18 Gaia ESO paper, this is a bit worrying, because plenty of
their 5500 - 6000 K dwarfs in NGC 2516 do show Li. The Boesgaard+ results seem
to imply that the majority (>90%) of NGC 2516's cluster members should show Li
in the relevant Teff range.

There is a question though about whether and how planets affect Li. This has
been debated for quiet sun-like stars. Israelian+09 wrote a nature paper
claiming planet-hosting stars had less Li than a "planet-free" comparison
sample, suggesting that more planets == less angular momentum for the star,
enabling deeper convective mixing. Baumann+10 and Ramirez+12 (a different
group, including Asplund) argued that Israelian+09 didn't correct for
age/metallicity properly, and that there was no effect. Delgado Mena+14 (the
same group as the initial claim) retorted with a "no, look, we are correcting,
and still see a difference". Figueira+14 and Delgado Mena+15, the same group,
continued to argue that they saw Li-depletion in planet hosts.

Despite all this, the lack of Li is worrying enough to me that any "triumphant
youth claim" will have to be toned down with a number of qualifiers. This is
fine -- and I think motivates the rotation period analysis even more strongly!

OTHER

Did you know that there is a sector 7 light-curve too? Omg!
Wasn't made in the main CDIPS paper because Kounkel & Covey 2019 was not part
of target list.

Yep. ELEANOR sector 7 shows a nice consistent spot signal.

Will need to include this for the eventual analysis.

Lithium cont'd

Sestito et al 2003 is a good counterpoint.
They took X-RAY SELECTED members of M7.
For optical counterparts that were "earlier" than say late G, G9, the xray
study (Prosser 1995) presumed that most of these corresponded to binaries with
a faint M dwarf secondary providing the xrays.
The MAJORITY of these stars though showed Li, at EW>50mA. (Like consistent with
>90%).
So yes, I think it's worth being a bit concerned about the lack of lithium in
TIC 268.

------------------------------------------

E.g., Delgado Mena+15 write
"Furthermore, we compare the observed spectra of several couples of stars with
very similar parameters that show differences in Li abundances up to 1.6 dex.
Therefore we show that neither age, mass, nor metallicity of a parent star is
the only cause for enhanced Li depletion in solar analogues."

"Israelian et al. (2009) confirm former results using the homogeneous and
high-quality HARPS GTO sample. They find that about 50% of 60 solar analogues
(Teff = T 2 ± 80 K) without detected planets had A(Li) ≥ 1.5, while only 2 out
of 24 planet hosts had high Li abundances."
