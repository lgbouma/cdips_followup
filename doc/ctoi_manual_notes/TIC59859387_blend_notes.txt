TIC 598:

    The neighbor star is TIC 767810561 == 5510676828723794176

    It is 3.3 arcsec away. If we had FOCUSED LCOGT observations, instead of
    DEFOCUSED, I think we might do better. 

    In defocus=2.5 ip band, the target star is 30px across.

    0.39" per pixel.

    So, 11.7 arcseconds across, when it's defocused.

    But in focus, it should be limited by the seeing. I.e., it should be just a
    few arcseconds.  The trick will be not saturating it.

    30 second exposures at 2.5mm defocus.

    It's a pretty bright star...
    The LCO exposure time calculator suggests 4 second exposures to avoid
    saturation.
    
    Subsequent SNR will probably be worse.
